# HTB Writeups

This repository contains my personal collection of Hack The Box (HTB) writeups, documenting the techniques, methodologies, and thought processes I used while enumerating, exploiting, and escalating privileges on various machines and challenges.  

These notes serve both as a learning journal and a resource for others studying penetration testing, preparing for certifications, or simply looking to improve their offensive security mindset.  

All writeups are created strictly for educational purposes and **follow HTB’s rules**, meaning only retired machines and authorized content are included.

# Tracks

Hack The Box Tracks are curated, goal‑oriented learning paths designed to guide users through specific areas of cybersecurity.
